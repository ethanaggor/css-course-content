Specificity:

Specificity is what takes precedence over other CSS selectors & they have values from 1-1000

Classes are meant to be used multiple times, ID's are meant to be used for only one thing BY CONVENTION

Pseudoselectors:
Child selector must be applied to the CHILD and not the parent

The anchor tag is manipulated with the :link and :visited pseudoselectors

Advanced Selectors:

- Adjacent Sibling Selector
Selects the element that directly follows another

- General Sibling Combinator
Does exactly what the Advanced sibling selector does except they must have the same parent

- Child Selector
Selects every single DIRECT child of a parent

- Descendant Selector
ANY element that eventually propagates up to a parent

Attribute Selectors:
Selects HTML elements that have certain attributes

FORMULA:
[attr=value]
    The ^ makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value STARTS with ...
    The $ makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value ENDS with ...
    The * makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value CONTAINS ... anywhere
    The ~ only works for things separated by whitespace
    The | makes it if it includes an attribute or another

You can add multiple classes within a class attribute

Properties:
They are contained within selectors (which target the element) but the properties give it its change

ex.
property: value;

The CSS General Rule:

selector {(CSS block)
    property: value;
    property2: value2;
}

Types of Colors:
- CSS color codes, already in the programming language itself and used for quick fixes

- HEX code
Separated in pairs, the first two are red, next green, next blue

- rgb
rgb(r, g, b)

Coloring Text

Background Colors:
Element selectors typically go at the top of the stylesheet

The property *background* also selects images and URLs
The background property can also be applied to text

Images/URL's in CSS
CSS Functions: They take a few inputs and process an output
ex. rgb() & url()

background, background-color, background-images

Other Background Properties:
Repeat: Repeat is the default value. No-repeat removes the property value

Background-size: 
ex. background-size: height width;
Cover: covers the entire given space
Contain: covers the entire given space as possible without messing with the proportion

Opacity/Transparency:
rgba: a stands for alpha and has a value from 0 to 1, 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%, it stands for the opacity of a color

Gradients:
A transition between colors where the colors diffuse into another

Radial: Circular
Background-size: cover does not work on radial gradients
ex. background: radial-gradient(circle, red 20%, blue 40%, green 55%);

Linear: Can go left to right, top to bottom, or diagonally
ex. background: linear-gradient(to right, color, color);

Other uses:
to top
to bottom
to right
to left
diagonally:
to bottom right
to top left
etc etc

Angles:
45deg
-90deg
etc etc

Types of units:
Absolute units:
cm, mm, in

Relative units:
%'s, em, vw, vh

Pixels are a little bit different, they are absolute values but are relatively scaled based on the device

em represents the size relative to the standard font-size

Viewport is the dimensions of what you are currently viewing

Vh & Vw are view height and view width

1vw is 1% of the viewport width
