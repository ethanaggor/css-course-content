Specificity:

Specificity is what takes precedence over other CSS selectors & they have values from 1-1000

Classes are meant to be used multiple times, ID's are meant to be used for only one thing BY CONVENTION

Pseudoselectors:
Child selector must be applied to the CHILD and not the parent

The anchor tag is manipulated with the :link and :visited pseudoselectors
