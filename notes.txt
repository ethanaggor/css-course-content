Specificity:

Specificity is what takes precedence over other CSS selectors & they have values from 1-1000

Classes are meant to be used multiple times, ID's are meant to be used for only one thing BY CONVENTION

Pseudoselectors:
Child selector must be applied to the CHILD and not the parent

The anchor tag is manipulated with the :link and :visited pseudoselectors

Advanced Selectors:

- Adjacent Sibling Selector
Selects the element that directly follows another

- General Sibling Combinator
Does exactly what the Advanced sibling selector does except they must have the same parent

- Child Selector
Selects every single DIRECT child of a parent

- Descendant Selector
ANY element that eventually propagates up to a parent

Attribute Selectors:
Selects HTML elements that have certain attributes

FORMULA:
[attr=value]
    The ^ makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value STARTS with ...
    The $ makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value ENDS with ...
    The * makes it so that it selects the attribute if the value CONTAINS ... anywhere
    The ~ only works for things separated by whitespace

You can add multiple classes within a class attribute
